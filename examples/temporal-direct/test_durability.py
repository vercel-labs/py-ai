"""Durability tests for ``temporal-direct/main.py``.

Three checks:

1. **Happy path** — the workflow runs end-to-end via an embedded dev
   server and produces a non-empty text answer.

2. **Replay determinism** — the recorded event history of a successful
   run replays cleanly against the current workflow code (no
   non-determinism error). This is what catches accidental sources of
   non-determinism (clocks, randomness, set iteration order, etc.) in
   the loop or the framework.

3. **Activity caching across a worker restart** — start worker1 in a
   subprocess, kick off the workflow, ``SIGINT`` the subprocess
   mid-flight, then start a fresh in-process worker. A file-backed
   activity log proves that activities completed before the crash are
   *not* re-executed: their results are served from history.

   The subprocess pattern matters: a graceful in-process
   ``worker.shutdown()`` leaves the cached ``WorkflowInstance`` alive
   in memory with its asyncio tasks pending, which produces unraisable
   context-mismatch errors when GC eventually closes those coroutines.
   Real worker death is process death, where in-memory residue is a
   non-issue — and that's what we simulate here. (We use ``SIGINT``
   rather than ``SIGKILL`` so the subprocess gets a chance to cancel
   its in-flight activity instead of leaving it pinned for
   ``start_to_close_timeout``; the subprocess exits via ``os._exit``
   to skip the GC pass that would otherwise emit the same unraisables.)
