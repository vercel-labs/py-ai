"""Subprocess worker for ``test_durability``.

Run in its own process so the parent test can shut it down by signal
instead of doing a graceful in-process ``worker.shutdown()`` — which
leaves cached ``WorkflowInstance``\\ s and their pending asyncio tasks
alive in memory and produces unraisable context-mismatch errors at
interpreter shutdown. With a subprocess, the residue dies with the
process; the parent never sees it.

We use ``SIGINT`` (raises ``KeyboardInterrupt`` → ``asyncio.run``
cleans up → ``Worker.__aexit__`` runs ``shutdown()``) rather than
``SIGKILL``. ``SIGKILL`` would leave any in-flight activity hanging
until ``start_to_close_timeout`` fires (5 min for the LLM activity),
which makes the test painfully slow. The ``SIGINT`` path is what a
production rollout's ``preStop``/``SIGTERM`` looks like in spirit.

Activities log every completion to a file named in
``DURABILITY_ACTIVITY_LOG`` so the parent can count executions across
the process boundary.
