"""Hooks: suspension points that require external input to continue.

Usage inside an agent loop::

    result = await hook("approve_delete", payload=ToolApproval, metadata={"tool": "rm"})
    if result.granted:
        ...

Resolution from outside the loop::

    resolve_hook("approve_delete", {"granted": True})

Cancellation::

    await cancel_hook("approve_delete", reason="denied")

Behavior depends on ``interrupt_loop``:

interrupt_loop=False (default, long-running): the await blocks until
resolve_hook() is called from outside (e.g. websocket handler, API endpoint).

interrupt_loop=True (serverless): if no resolution is available, the
hook's future is cancelled. The branch receives CancelledError and dies
cleanly. On re-entry, call resolve_hook() before agent.run() to
pre-register the resolution, then pass checkpoint= to replay.
