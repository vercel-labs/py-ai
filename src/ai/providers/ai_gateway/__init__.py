"""AI Gateway provider.

Usage::

    from ai.providers import ai_gateway, anthropic, openai

    model = ai_gateway("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4")
    ids = await ai_gateway.list()

    # Provider-specific request options pass through as raw Gateway body fields.
    async with ai.stream(
        model,
        msgs,
        params={"providerOptions": {"anthropic": {"speed": "fast"}}},
        tools=[anthropic.tools.web_search(max_uses=5)],
    ) as s:
        ...

    # The gateway also exposes its own provider-executed tools that work
    # with any gateway-routed model regardless of the underlying provider.
    async with ai.stream(
        model,
        msgs,
        tools=[ai_gateway.tools.perplexity_search(max_results=5)],
    ) as s:
        ...

The heavy ``.adapter`` module is loaded lazily so that ``import ai`` does
not pull in ``httpx`` and other I/O libraries at import time.  This matters
for sandboxed runtimes (e.g. Temporal workflow workers).
