    ``asyncio.TaskGroup``'s ``__aexit__`` wraps any body exception (including
    ``GeneratorExit``) into a ``BaseExceptionGroup``. Inside an async
    generator that means ``aclose()`` propagates an ``ExceptionGroup`` instead
    of the bare ``GeneratorExit`` the protocol expects, and the aclose-task
    ends up with an unretrieved exception. Wrapping the ``async with
    TaskGroup(...)`` block in this manager unwraps the group back to a plain
    ``GeneratorExit`` so the close path stays clean.
